	<h4>Biography</h4>
	<p> My name is Keagan Swanepoel and this is my Resume site. <br><br>
	 Ever since I was a kid I have wanted to work as a Software Developer or programmer just like my brothers and throughout my life I have worked hard to achieve this goal and I believe that I may be a valuable asset to your company
	</p>
	<p>
	 	As a graduate of BS Information Technology, I have spent the last 3 years of my life honing my skills to create better systems for practice. <br> In my days in College, I was able to work together and coordinate a small team of programmers to create mock-ups of apps and even full systems. I have also attended a few seminars such as Annual Symposium on Business, Technology and Social Sciences Interventions (BTSSI) in Pasig last May 22, 2022.

	<p>
		Further, as a member of the UC robotics club, I was able to program different sorts of movements for very simple robots. We were able to make an assortment of different small robotics projects that could be useful to your company.
	</p>

		Should I be accepted as a member of your company, I shall assist in the development of creating and designing improvements to your current software. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Hoping to hear a positive response.
