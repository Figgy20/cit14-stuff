	<h4>Biography</h4>
	<p> My name is Keagan Swanepoel and this is my Resume site. <br><br>
	 Ever since I was a kid I have wanted to work as a Software Developer or programmer just like my brothers and throughout my life I have worked hard to achieve this goal and I believe that I may be a valuable asset to your company
	</p>
	<p>
	 	As a graduate of BS Information Technology, I have spent the last 3 years of my life honing my skills to create better systems for practice. <br> In my days in College, I was able to work together and coordinate a small team of programmers to create mock-ups of apps and even full systems. I have also attended a few seminars such as Annual Symposium on Business, Technology and Social Sciences Interventions (BTSSI) in Pasig last May 22, 2022.
